## *I had no ethernet for a few days so I was bored of doing nothing and came up with that programm idea*
## It works good with .txt files. I tried it with some other file extensions and it SUCK cuz I use single bytes for separating data in compressed file
I tried to make something like zip,
but I had no idea how to make actuall compression (tried to figure it out by myself) of bytes so it will weight less than original file.
So, this programm rn just creates something like folder, which can't be opened without decompressing it through the programm
(ig I need to make an encryption, so people can't open compressed file in byte-reader programm and see what's inside).
Also, because of byte-separators I use, if file which will be compressed have same bytes inside, programm will create slop. (I'll make something with that)
