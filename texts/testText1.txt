Hello, whoever read this.
I test my program on .txt files because I can see if there's invalid (for ASCII) symbols...   .-3 spaces
(P.s. tested on another files extensions and it works well)

(some break lines)

.     .5 spaces

...or if theres data loss.
Blah blah blah.
Deltarune is peak.
What          ?
    to        ?
      type    ?
          here?
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

I really don't know what to type here cuz there's not much I can type for testing.
Also I use "Guidebook.txt" for tests cuz its kinda big file.
          Its guide for game called "Nethack"
!@#$%^&*()_-+=1234567890!"â„–;%:?*
However I haven't played it (theres.. unusual controls)
((((0)((((())(((((()))))))00)))))))))
((())(((((000))))))))))))
That's end of the file ig.
